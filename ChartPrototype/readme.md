A)
Needed a Model, View, and a page to put them on.

Model needed a representation, and a way to change values and update.
View needed a graphical representation, play/pause/step buttons.
Additionally needed were buttons for presets.



B) Modules:

jquery-3.1.1.min -- JQuery
cmodel.js        -- The model of my Game of Life.
cwidget.js       -- The view of the Game of Life. Dependent on cmodel.
coolpatterns.js  -- setup for the presets. Dependent on cmodel and cwidget.
index.html       -- The webpage on which the view appears.

defaultstyle.css -- style sheet for making this page pretty
tests.html       -- tests
tests.js         -- tests

C) I used functionals to initialize the array of arrays.
