# StitchHub

(Soon to be) A social network application for users to share knitting, crochetting, and cross-stitching patterns. 

## How to run

1. Start a MongoDB server via the default port (`mongod --dbpath=[existing_directory]`)
2. Install the necessary node packages (`npm install`)
3. Run the application (`npm start`)

## MVP Implementation

The MVP focused on the creative aspects of the application instead of social. We allow thse who visit the site to create and remix charts. However, there are no user accounts and hence there is also no notion of liking, saving, commenting, or following.
